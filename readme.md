This code defines a Solidity contract for a simple token named "Metacrafters" (MTAC).
1. Token Creation and Management:
The contract is owned by the address that deploys it.
The owner can mint (create) new tokens for any address.
The owner can also burn (destroy) existing tokens from any address.

2. Token Transfers:
Anyone can transfer their tokens to another address.
Transfers are only successful if the sender has enough tokens.

3. Record Keeping:
The contract keeps track of the total supply of tokens in circulation.
It maintains a mapping to store the balance of each address holding tokens.

4. Events and Error Handling:
Events are emitted for minting, burning, and transferring tokens, providing a record of these actions.
A custom error is defined to handle situations where an account tries to burn or transfer more tokens than it has.

Overall, this contract provides a basic structure for a token on the blockchain, allowing for creation, destruction, and transfer of MTAC tokens.
